# honesty-ai

Honesty AI started as an independent research project.

We are trialing our ChatGPT-checker Honesty AI to investigate if educators would need it.


As passionate educators and researchers from UC Berkeley, we aimed to find solutions for ChatGPT-plagiarism as a “thread to academia” (The Guardian). Talking to 30+ teachers, we realized that short-term, there is a need to differentiate AI-generated output from human-created text.

But the long-term the question is: How can AI actively support students to learn more effectively? For example by detecting error patterns in their writing and assisting the teacher in giving individualized feedback. 

Thus, we are releasing Honesty AI not as a solution, but rather as the start of a journey: Kindly try and share Honesty AI to let us know (contact form on honesty-ai.com) if you think such a tool makes - or how we can go one step further than GPTZero and see AI as an asset instead of a thread.

## Usage

We attached our webserver configurations and the dector app as the most important part of the detector.
